Cover Managing Software for High School
A cover admin can allocate the number of hours a teacher has done overtime or covered and keep track of it. They can also see a real time graph to show
which department has done the most amount of overtime/covers and generate a report in a txt file. They can also set limits to the overtime a teacher in a 
department can do and once breached the app will send an alert onto the main screen.
